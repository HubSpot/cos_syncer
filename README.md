PLEASE NOTE that HubSpot now supports uploading and downloading files via FTP ([http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/hubspot-ftp](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tools/hubspot-ftp)). HubSpot will stop supporting the COS Uploader on Jan. 1st 2016.

<hr/>

The cos_uploader will watch the contents of a folder on your local hard drive and upload the templates and static files to the HubSpot COS every time a file child is changed.

Instructions on how to install and use the cos_uploader are here (for use with the pre-compiled binary):  
http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/install-cos-uploader

We have two tutorials that provide a full guide to using the cos_uploader with your portal:
* [Editing your styles and assets locally using the COS Uploader](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/editing-your-styles-and-assets-locally)
* [Building a complete COS powered site from raw HTML/CSS](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/building-from-plain-html)

For instructions on running the cos_uploader locally from the source, see this document:
