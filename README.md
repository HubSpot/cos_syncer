HubSpot dropped support for the COS Uploader on Jan. 1st 2016.

**The [HubSpot local development tools](https://designers.hubspot.com/docs/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli) provide upload/download capabilities with HubSpot and are the recommended tool for developers.**


The rest of this readme is preserved just for historical context, links may no longer work.

The cos_uploader will watch the contents of a folder on your local hard drive and upload the templates and static files to the HubSpot COS every time a file child is changed.

Instructions on how to install and use the cos_uploader are here (for use with the pre-compiled binary):  
http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/install-cos-uploader

We have two tutorials that provide a full guide to using the cos_uploader with your portal:
* [Editing your styles and assets locally using the COS Uploader](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/editing-your-styles-and-assets-locally)
* [Building a complete COS powered site from raw HTML/CSS](http://designers.hubspot.com/docs/tutorials/building-from-plain-html)
